A Twitter bot that uses Azure's AI to perform sentiment analysis of tweets live.  If a tweet is determined to be positive it likes and retweets the tweet.  The goal is to reinforce positive online behavior.  This is an example of how to make AI work for us instead of just for marketers and other entities that have motivations beyond what is best for humanity.
